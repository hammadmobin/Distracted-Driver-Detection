# Distracted-Driver-Detection
Project focuses on detecting distracted driving behaviors using machine learning models. By leveraging MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet-B0, we classify driver distractions, such as texting or talking on the phone, from 2D dashboard camera images. This approach aims to improve road safety and reduce distracted driving risks.
