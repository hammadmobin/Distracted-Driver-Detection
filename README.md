# Distracted-Driver-Detection
Project focuses on detecting distracted driving behaviors using machine learning models. By leveraging MobileNetV2 and EfficientNet-B0, we classify driver distractions, such as texting or talking on the phone, from 2D dashboard camera images. This approach aims to improve road safety and reduce distracted driving risks.

## Datasets
The project utilizes the [State Farm Distracted Driver Detection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/state-farm-distracted-driver-detection), which captures real-world driver behaviors in a controlled setting. It includes images labeled across 10 predefined classes of distracting activities, enabling effective model training for driver behavior classification.

The dataset is well-balanced, with approximately equal representation of each class, and includes images captured under varying lighting conditions to simulate real-world scenarios. Its moderate size makes it ideal for transfer learning, leveraging pre-trained models and fine-tuning them for this specific task.

This methodology enhances model robustness, allowing accurate classification of driver behaviors even with limited data.
